Before a Tsunami (Preparedness)

âœ… Know Your Risk
Check if you live in a tsunami-prone coastal area.
Learn evacuation routes and nearest high ground locations.

âœ… Create an Emergency Plan
Practice evacuation drills with your family.
Identify safe places at least 30 meters (100 feet) above sea level or 2 km (1.2 miles) inland.

âœ… Prepare an Emergency Kit
Water, food, flashlight, batteries, whistle, first aid kit.
Important documents (ID, insurance, emergency contacts).

âœ… Stay Informed
Follow weather updates and tsunami warnings on TV, radio, or mobile apps.
Sign up for local disaster alerts.


During a Tsunami (Response)

If a Tsunami Warning is Issued
ðŸ”¹ Move to Higher Ground Immediately!

Do not wait for official warnings if you feel a strong earthquake.

Evacuate inland or to high ground without delay.
ðŸ”¹ Natural Warning Signs of a Tsunami:

Strong earthquake (lasting over 20 seconds near the coast).
Sudden ocean recession (water pulls away from the shore unusually far).

Loud roaring sound coming from the ocean.
ðŸš¨ If you notice these signs, evacuate immediately! ðŸš¨
ðŸ“Œ Do NOT go near the shore to watch the waves!

After a Tsunami (Recovery & Safety Measures)

âœ… Wait for Official Clearance
Tsunami waves may come in multiple surgesâ€”do not return too soon.
Follow emergency authority updates before going back to coastal areas.

âœ… Avoid Flooded Areas
Do not walk or drive through floodwaters (they may contain debris or be electrically charged).

âœ… Check for Injuries & Help Others
Administer first aid if necessary.
Assist children, elderly, and disabled individuals.

âœ… Stay Alert for Aftershocks
Another tsunami could follow due to seismic activity.

âœ… Report Damage & Seek Shelter if Needed
Check for damaged utilities (gas leaks, electrical hazards).
