Before a Landslide (Preparedness)

âœ… Know Your Risk
Identify if you live in a landslide-prone area (steep hillsides, near rivers or streams, or where previous landslides have occurred).
Look for warning signs like cracked walls, leaning trees, or water seeping from hillsides.

âœ… Create an Emergency Plan
Know the evacuation routes to reach higher, safer ground.
Make sure all family members understand where to go during a landslide.
Designate a meeting point in case you get separated.

âœ… Prepare an Emergency Kit
Water, non-perishable food, medications, flashlight, batteries.
First-aid supplies, documents, and a whistle.
A battery-powered radio to listen for emergency updates.

âœ… Improve Your Homeâ€™s Safety
Ensure proper drainage to prevent water buildup on slopes.
I
f you live on a hillside, consider reinforcing the slope or adding retaining walls.
Install flexible utility lines to reduce the chance of breakage during a landslide.
During a Landslide (Response)

If You Are in a Landslide-Prone Area
ðŸš¨ Listen to Alerts & Evacuate
Pay attention to weather forecasts and landslide warnings.

If you are instructed to evacuate, do so immediately.

If You Are Indoors
ðŸ”¹ Move to a Safe Place
Get away from windows, exterior walls, and doors.
Move to a higher floor or the center of the building, away from slopes.

If You Are Outdoors
ðŸ”¹ Move to Higher Ground
Quickly move away from hillsides, cliffs, or slopes.
Avoid rivers and streams that may become swollen with debris.
ðŸš« DO NOT attempt to cross or drive through flooded roadsâ€”landslides can create fast-moving, dangerous debris flows.

If You Are in a Vehicle
ðŸ”¹ Stop in a Safe Location
Pull over to the side of the road, away from hillsides or slopes.
Stay inside your vehicle until the landslide danger has passed.


After a Landslide (Recovery & Safety Measures)

âœ… Wait for Authorities to Declare the Area Safe
Avoid returning to an area affected by a landslide until officials clear it.

âœ… Check for Hazards
Be cautious of loose debris, mud, or damaged buildings.
Stay away from downed power lines and utility lines.

âœ… Look for Injuries & Administer First Aid
Provide medical help for any injuries.
Call emergency services if necessary.

âœ… Avoid Flooded Areas
Mudslides can be caused by rain, so be aware of the potential for further damage from heavy rainfall.

âœ… Help Others & Report Damage
Check on neighbors, especially vulnerable individuals (elderly, children, disabled).
Report blocked roads or landslide damage to authorities.""",
